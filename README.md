Kitchen_Maid
When it will start working, Kitchen Maid will be a grocery list/ recipe book. So far, I have some problems with bundle.js, I added authorization part with user/grocery table association. For update the db, you should open a different terminal and type 'npm run seed' For starting the app 'npm start' it listens by default 'http://localhost:3000' For entering (if it works) to app, dummy user email: ozlem@email.com and password: 12345. Good Luck!

P.S: I am not sure about following files, and put comments under them: server/api/index.js (routes has to checked) server/index.js (auth/routes)

Thanks a lot
